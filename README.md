# Andy-Nguyen-Portfolio
This is the first attempt at making a portfolio.

Starting with the header and nav bar, I made the nav bar change background color when it is hovered using pseudo elements.
Everything in the nav bar jumps to the approiate section after it's name.

For the main, I split it into a couple of sections to add my images and texts. I'm still having trouble when it comes to resizing the images. The images under project are there for placeholders. I'll be adding more projects as coding bootcamp 
continues. The larger image will take you to my first challenge I did.

For the contact, I did it the same as the nav bar. 

More update will soon to come.
